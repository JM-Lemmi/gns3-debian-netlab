# GNS3 Debian Appliance

This Appliance uses the official Debian Cloud image and adds an ISO with tools ready to install with apt install.

Use the information from my wiki to generate the iso image and install apt packages: https://wiki.julian-lemmerich.de/doku.php?id=knowledge_base:linux:apt-local
